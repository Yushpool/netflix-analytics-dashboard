## 💡 What I Learned

As someone still learning data and Python libraries like Seaborn, Streamlit, etc., I built this project with the help of **ChatGPT as a guide** to:
- Understand data cleaning and visualization
- Structure a real-world project
- Learn how to work with filters, charts, and UI in Streamlit

The logic, effort, and problem-solving were mine — and I learned something new with every step.
